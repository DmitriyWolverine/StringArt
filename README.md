# StringArt

Hello! Here you can look through my web-project, which I am going to present at the end of Java Development courses in High Technologies Park.
This is web implementation of String Art Gallery. Visitor can see works of several modern artists who are eager to be famous and publicated their works there, also visitor can show news of web-site and read some information about our gallery. Also There is a registration and authoriztion buttons. User who was authorizated can see more pictures and has an oportunity to order a picture. There are different ways to do it : 

1) You can book a picture, which is already done; 
2) you can send some photo and ask us to create picture "like this"; 
3) You can choose the option of doing the picture by yourself and artist will help you and create an algorithm for you.

Adminitrator is an artists and if he likes the order he can accept it. He can see users list and all requests to manage his time and inquiries.
